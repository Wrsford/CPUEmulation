# CPUEmulation

Decided to throw together a minimal stack machine. May end up as another 6502 emulator as well

Made up ops, wrote a preprocessor, compiler, and assembler. Should be able to build for any arch and run.

To run: Xcode

Contributing: Honestly, I would be surprised if you wanted to. Pull requests I suppose.

Goal: Wanted to put together a very small instruction set so I could put together the stack machine in other languages and just use the existing binaries.

Issues: Haven't done logical operators at this point. Haven't even put together a multiplication function yet. Floating point? I don't think so pal. 

Pros: I can probably put those together with the existing instruction set, or I'll the needed instructions for it.

Cons: I recall floating point math can get bloated with SISC
